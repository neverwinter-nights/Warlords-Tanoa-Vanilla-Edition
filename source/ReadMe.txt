[h1]1.	Four Island Territory.[/h1]

The mission uses four large islands to place sectors and assets. The territory includes almost a hundred of sectors (95 to be precise) guarded by neutral forces. Some islands have passable bridges between them, some islands are surrounded only with water and nothing more. The playable territory makes the players use all kinds of vehicles available in the game -- from infantries and land vehicles to water transport and aircraft vehicles. All this makes the gameplay more difficult and more interesting than an ordinary gameplay on an Altis map terrain.

[h1]2.	Tropical Units.[/h1]

As the action happens on tropical islands, the units used in the mission have the tropical colours. There is, however, a small exception, because some units in vanilla Arma 3 do not have their tropical counterparts. For some reason Bohemia Interactive decided that we do not need all the units in tropical colours. So, for such unique units, their classical variants are used.

[h1]3.	Limited Fast Travel.[/h1]

When fast travel is switched on in the mission settings, it is enabled only for those sectors which have either an airfield or a helipad. This feature simulates a realistic gameplay with players using transport vehicles as in real life. Authors of this mission have been playing Warlords missions for some time and have seen that all the time played almost none of the players have ever used transport vehicles for its direct purpose. Limited fast travel with transport vehicles' usage bring more role play into the game, stimulates a healthy team play and makes the mission more difficult and more realistic.

[h1]4.	Extended Assets.[/h1]

The mission uses a lot of additional assets available for purchase by players. This includes Huron containers and a flatbed truck which can carry them, additional types of boxes, additional types of vehicles including a Bobcat CRV for servicing vehicles, a Scorcher artillery vehicle, several kinds of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), sandbag defences and so on.

[h1]5.	Updated Prices.[/h1]

The mission features new and corrected prices which should make the gameplay more interesting and more difficult. Heavily armoured vehicles and battle air planes have increased prices comparing to the default Warlords mission setting. As opposed to it, radars and SAMs have a slightly decreased costs to stimulate players to use defence more actively. Sectors' income is also slightly decreased. This have been done on purpose, this stimulates players to use more team work, to use money transfers, which are now almost costless, to save money for more powerful weapons and finally to be more careful with expensive vehicles.

[h1]6.	Strategic Oriented Gameplay.[/h1]

While the fast travel is limited to helipads and airfields, while deadly weapons are very expensive, while the teams must use more team work to reach their goals, the gameplay becomes more strategic oriented and realistic. Instead of buying tonnes of air planes and spamming an enemy with bombs, the players now have to think first and to plan everything. Defence of airports becomes one of the strategic aims of the gameplay because such sectors provide means of transportation and aircraft vehicles. Crews of land vehicles now need to plan their route to the front line and use help of air vehicles where possible. Flatbed trucks or transport helicopters together with containerized assets provide a good way to save money by not buying the wheels again and again. Neutral vehicles can be captured if they are not totally destroyed. All this makes game more difficult but in the end brings more fun.

[h1]7.	Other Features.[/h1]

7.1.	As opposed to a vanilla Warlords framework, in this variant of Warlords mission players start the game with an empty inventory. After re-spawn player's inventory is also cleared. This makes the mission more difficult. Players now have to co-operate with their team mates and buy various boxes and crates. 

7.2.	Please, also note that sandbags can be transported with appropriate vehicles using the Cargo Manager add-on which is recommended for this mission.

7.3.	The recommended Vehicle Towing add-on allows players to tow light vehicles with heavy vehicles and to put vehicles onto their wheels if they have been accidentally turned over.

7.4.	The recommended Enhanced Movement Rework add-on allows players to climb small buildings and their roofs, containers, rocks and many other objects which are unusable with the vanilla game engine.

7.5.	The recommended Advanced Garbage Collector add-on helps to show almost a constant number of frames per second with huge numbers of corpses on the ground. This enables additional play strategies which are especially important in the early stages of the game. Players can use weapons and items looted from the corpses which they may find in battles. The time to collect garbage has been increased to one hour to make the gameplay more realistic.
